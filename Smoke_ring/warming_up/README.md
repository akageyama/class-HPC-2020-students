# class-hpc-smoke-ring

## burgers_equation

This directory contains a stand-alone program, a simple solver of Burgers eq.
Reading (and running) this code will help you to understand the smoke-ring code,
because the rogramming style and the adopted numerical schemes (the finite difference
method with Runge-Kutta integrator) are common.

## Prerequisite

gnuplot and ImageMagic (convert command) for visualization (animated graph).

## Usage

Just type make.

## Basic equation

Burgers equation.

## Numerical method

Second-order central difference with 4-th order Runge-Kutta integration.

## Boundary condition

Periodic boundary condition, with the length two pi.

## Programing language

Fortran 2003.
